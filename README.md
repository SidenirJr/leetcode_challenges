# 🚀 LeetCode or HackerRank Challenges Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode and HackerRank playground**! 🎮  
Here you'll find all my attempts to conquer the world of algorithms, one bug at a time.

## 🏆 Mission

I bravely try to solve **one challenge every day** (or at least every time I remember 😅) to level up my programming logic and keep my brain from turning into spaghetti code.

## 🤓 Why?

- Sharpen my coding skills
- Flex my logical muscles
- Collect cool badges (and maybe a few tears)

## 📅 Progress

Check out my daily grind in the folders above!  
If you see a solution that looks weird... that's called "creative problem solving." 😉
